## Intent

Allow dynamic adjustment of worker concurrency via hotkey during unsupervised sessions.

## Spec

Add a hotkey in the tmux (and zellij if added by then) setup that can alter the concurrency setting dynamically. For example, if we have 3 workers, we should be able to dial up to 5 or down to 1.

### Inspiration
Similar to the cmd-u mapping in ~/configs that launches a session-switch modal - a modal interface would be ideal for this.

### Requirements
- Add hotkey binding in tmux configuration
- If zellij support exists by then, add equivalent binding there
- Should launch a modal/picker interface to select new concurrency level
- Modal should show current concurrency and allow increment/decrement
- Changes should take effect immediately (spawn/despawn workers as needed)

### Implementation Notes
- Look at how session-switch modal works in ~/configs for UX inspiration
- May need a new command like `crank tmux --mode unsupervised set-concurrency N` or similar
- Consider using fzf or similar for the modal picker

### Acceptable Output
- Hotkey works in tmux unsupervised session
- Can increase/decrease worker count on the fly
- Workers spawn/despawn correctly
